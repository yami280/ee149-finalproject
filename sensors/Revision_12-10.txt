***Library Specifications***

note: Different sensors require different voltages, and different protocols

BMP180 - Atmospheric Pressure Sensor (I2C Protocol)
HIH6130 - Temperature and Humidity Sensor (I2C Protocol)
MaxSonar - Long Range Proximity Sensor (I2C Protocol)
MQ-2 - Combustable Gas Sensor (Analog)
MQ-7 - Carbon Monoxide Sensor (Analog)
SoundDetector - Sound Detector (Analog)
TSL2561_I2C - Luminosity Sesnsor (I2C Protocol)

@update
removed:
	VCNL4000 - Close proximity sensor
	ITG3200 - Gyro sensor
reason:
	Faulty Sensors

renamed:
	TSL2561_I2C -> TSL2561

@todo
Create libraries for MQ2 and MQ7


***Possible Applications***
Maybe to show what it is used for

Basic Household data

Dust sensor
Monoxide sensor
Environment Pressure
Temperature
Humidity

eg:
Show the recommended values for these
Maybe if these values are not met, we can give hints on what to do
Or warning messages directly to your phone! Especially for monoxide and Dust sensor !!!


Life Chore data

Proximity sensor (long distance)
Luminosity
Sound

eg:
Luminosity sensor to tell how sunny today will be? What else can it be used? Not sure
Sound sensor - Detect if someone breaks in?
Proximity sensor - Show maybe garbages is full, mail came.
