To run the server: 
./server.py
This will start a server on http://localhost:8080/.

Right now, since we're just doing a simple demo, there's no need for having a fullblown database,
so I'm just saving everything in a simple text file called door_status.txt where the first line
is a boolean for whether the door is open, and the second is the userid of who opened the door.
Later, when we have different kinds of GET or POST requests, we might want to use an XML instead 
or something.

GET requests:
-If you make a GET request to http://localhost:8080/, it will show you one of the following:
The door is closed.
The door is open, and has been opened by _______.

POST requests:
-If you make a POST request, your params should be in the format: userid=1234&event=1
-To make a POST request from the terminal:
curl --data "userid=1234&event=1" http://localhost:8080/
This will change the message to:
The door is open, and has been opened by 1234.
I have no idea how you're going to be doing the POST request from your end, so this might not work with that.
Just let me know when your part is done and I'll try to figure out how to make it work with that.
